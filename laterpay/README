1) INSTALLATION
================

Step 1: Upload the LaterPay WordPress plugin on the ‘Install Plugins’ page of your WordPress installation
        (/wp-admin/plugin-install.php?tab=upload) and activate it on the ‘Plugins’ page (/wp-admin/plugins.php).
        The WordPress plugin will show up in the admin sidebar with a callout pointing at it.
Step 2: Click on it and fill in your LaterPay Sandbox Merchant ID and Sandbox API Key on the ‘Get Started’ page
        (your LaterPay Sandbox Merchant ID and Sandbox API Key are available in your LaterPay merchant backend).
Step 3: Choose a global default price on the ‘Get Started’ page. This price will be set for all your blog posts.
        If you choose 0.00 Euro, all posts remain free. You can later adjust your prices in detail.
        After clicking the ‘Activate LaterPay on this site!’ button, LaterPay is active on your blog and you can
        start monetizing your posts!


2) REQUIREMENTS
================

Your WordPress installation must fulfill the following requirements to be compatible with the LaterPay WordPress plugin:

- PHP version       >= 5.2.4
- WordPress version >= 3.3 (green)


3) FEATURES
============

The LaterPay WordPress plugin offers the following features:

- PRICING
    - Price types: The plugin allows you to set different price types for your blog posts:
        - Global default price: This price is by default applied to all new and existing posts of the blog.
        - Category default price: This price is applied to all new and existing posts in a given category.
          If a category default price is set, it overwrites the global default price.
          E.g. setting a category default price of 0.00 Euro, while having set a global default price of 0.49 Euro,
          makes all posts in that category free.
        - Individual price: This price can be set for each post.
          It overwrites both the category default price and the global default price for the respective article.
          E.g. setting an individual price of 0.19 Euro with a category default price of 0.10 Euro and a global
          default price of 0.00 Euro results in a price for that post of 0.19 Euro.
    - Default Currency: The plugin allows you to set the default currency for your blog.
      Changing the default currency will not change the prices you have set, but only the currency code
      that is displayed next to the price.
    - Advanced Pricing: For every single post, you can set an advanced pricing scheme that changes the price of a blog post
      over time. You can choose from several presets that you can adjust to your needs.
      E.g. you can offer a breaking news post for 0.49 Euro for the first day and then automatically reduce the price
      to 0.05 Euro to increase your sales.

- PRESENTATION
    - LaterPay button: Each post with a price > 0.00 Euro automatically contains a LaterPay button next to the post title.
    - Teaser content: Every post you sell with LaterPay has to contain a teaser.
      The teaser is shown to the user before he has purchased a post.
      The plugin automatically generates teaser content by taking the first 120 words of every existing post.
      You can refine the teaser content on the ‘Add / Edit Post’ page.
      You have the choice between two presentation modes for your teaser content:
        - Teaser only: This mode shows only the teaser with an unobtrusive purchase link below.
        - Teaser + overlay: This mode shows the teaser, an excerpt of the full content under a semi-transparent overlay
          that briefly explains LaterPay's benefits. The plugin never loads the full content before a user has bought it.
    - LaterPay invoice indicator: The plugin provides a code snippet you can insert into your theme that displays
      the user's current LaterPay invoice total and provides a direct link to his LaterPay user backend.
      You don't have to integrate this snippet, but we recommend it for transparency reasons.

- SECURITY
    File protection: The plugin secures files in paid posts against downloading them via a shared direct link.
    So even if a user purchases a post and shares the direct link to a contained file, other users won't be able
    to access that file, unless they've already bought the post.
    By default, the plugin protects the most common filetypes, not including audio or video files.
    If you want to protect additional filetypes, you can modify the list of protected filetypes in the settings.php
    of the LaterPay WordPress plugin (/wp-admin/plugin-editor.php?file=laterpay%2Flaterpay-config.php).

- CRAWLER FRIENDLINESS
    - Social media: The plugin supports Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ crawlers, so it won't hurt your social media reach.
    - Google and Google News: The plugin also supports Google and Google News crawlers.
      They will never have access to the full content but only to your teaser content.
      So depending on the presentation mode you've chosen, Google will access only the teaser content or
      the teaser content plus an excerpt of the full content.

- TEST AND LIVE MODE
    - Test mode: The test mode lets you test your plugin configuration. While providing the full plugin functionality,
      no real transactions are processed. We highly recommend to configure and test the integration of the LaterPay
      WordPress plugin into your site on a test system, not on your production system.
    - Live mode: After integrating and testing the plugin, you might want to start selling content and process real
      transactions. Mail us the signed merchant contract and the necessary identification documents and we will send you
      LaterPay API credentials for switching your plugin to live mode.

- STATISTICS
    If you open a post as a logged-in admin (or user with adequate rights), you will see a statistics tab with the
    following data about the respective post:
      - Total sales: The total number of sales of this particular post
      - Total revenue: The total revenue of this particular post
      - Today's revenue
      - Today's visitors
      - Today's conversion rate: The share of visitors that actually purchased
      - History charts for sales, revenue, and conversion rate of the last 30 days
    Please note that the provided statistics are only indicators and not binding in any way.


4) UPDATING
============

The LaterPay WordPress plugin features the regular WordPress update-mechanism.
If an update is available, WordPress will notify you about it on the ‘WordPress Updates’ page (/wp-admin/update-core.php).
The update itself is performed by a single click on the ‘Update Plugins’ button.
